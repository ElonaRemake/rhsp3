# exrand.hpi

A reimplementation of the `exrand` library used in Elona and probably some other HSP software. This is primarily for
demonstration purposes, but can be used as an actual library if you wish.

The original [`exrand_100.lzh`] was created by [D.N.A.Softwares] and can still be found through the Internet Archive.
